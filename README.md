### About D&D Spells

D&D Spells is an application that uses a Dungeons and Dragons API to quickly find spells when playing D&D. With the D&D Spells application, players can both search and favourite their most used spells——allowing them to dive more into the world of role-playing.

### Purpose

To create an application using an API, TypeScript, and React.

### Demo

A working demo of D&D Spells can be found on [Netlify](https://dndspells.netlify.app/).

### Tools and Technologies

I developed the application using the following tools and technologies:

- TypeScript
- React
- APIs
- Styled Components
- CSS3
